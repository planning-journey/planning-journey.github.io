# 2026-01-05 - Calendar Component Border Property

## Description
The user requested to add a property to the `Calendar` component to control its border visibility. The default behavior should maintain the border, but instances of the `Calendar` within `DateSelectorModal` should be rendered without a border.

## Changes Made

1.  **`src/components/Calendar.tsx` modified:**
    *   A new optional prop, `showBorder?: boolean`, was added to the `CalendarProps` interface. Its default value was set to `true` within the component's destructuring.
    *   The `onSelectRange` prop was also made optional in `CalendarProps`.
    *   The outermost `<div>` element of the `Calendar` component was modified to conditionally apply Tailwind CSS border classes (`border border-gray-200 dark:border-slate-700`) based on the `showBorder` prop.

2.  **`src/components/DateSelectorModal.tsx` modified:**
    *   The `Calendar` component within `DateSelectorModal` now explicitly receives `showBorder={false}` as a prop, ensuring it renders without a border.

## Verification
(Instructions provided to the user)
The user is instructed to verify that `Calendar` components maintain their border by default (e.g., in `GoalEditorModal`), while the `Calendar` within the `DateSelectorModal` (accessed via `TaskEditorModal`) renders without a border.
