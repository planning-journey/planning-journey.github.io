### User Request:
할 일 입력 폼에서 목표를 선택하고 할 일을 입력하고 나면 다시 할 일 입력 폼의 인풋 요소로 포커스 해줘.

### Plan:
1.  **Understand the Request:** The user wants the task input field to be refocused after selecting a goal and entering a task. Initial investigation revealed that the `TaskEditorModal` closes after saving a task, making direct refocusing within the modal problematic unless the modal's behavior changes.
2.  **Identify Relevant Components:**
    *   `src/components/TaskEditorModal.tsx`: Confirmed to be the "task input form."
    *   `src/components/DailyDetailArea.tsx`: Renders `TaskEditorModal` and manages its state.
    *   `src/components/TaskList.tsx`, `src/components/TaskItem.tsx`: Checked these to confirm no other external task input forms exist.
3.  **Clarify User Intent:** Since `TaskEditorModal` closes after saving, the request implies two possibilities:
    *   The user wants the modal to *stay open* after adding a *new* task, clear its fields, and refocus the input for continuous entry. This seemed the most logical interpretation for improved UX.
    *   The user refers to an external task input that doesn't exist.
    The interpretation chosen was to modify `TaskEditorModal`'s behavior for new tasks.
4.  **Detailed Plan:**
    *   Modify `TaskEditorModal.tsx` to prevent closing if a *new* task is added (i.e., `taskToEdit` is null).
    *   Clear the `taskText` and `description` fields, and `selectedGoalId` after adding a new task.
    *   Refocus on the `taskText` input field after clearing for new tasks.
    *   Ensure the modal still closes as before when an *existing* task is edited.

### Execution:
1.  **Add `useRef` to `TaskEditorModal.tsx`:** Added `taskTextInputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);` to `TaskEditorModal.tsx` to programmatically control focus for the task text input field.
2.  **Attach `useRef` to Input Element:** Attached `ref={taskTextInputRef}` to the `<input type="text" id="taskText">` element within `TaskEditorModal.tsx`.
3.  **Modify `handleSave` Function:** Updated the `handleSave` function in `TaskEditorModal.tsx` to include conditional logic:
    *   If `!taskToEdit` (a new task is being added):
        *   `onSave(updatedTask)` is called.
        *   `setTaskText('')`, `setDescription('')`, and `setSelectedGoalId(undefined)` are called to clear the form.
        *   `taskTextInputRef.current.focus()` is called to refocus the input field.
    *   If `taskToEdit` exists (an existing task is being edited):
        *   `onSave(updatedTask)` is called.
        *   `onClose()` is called to close the modal.

### Conclusion:
The `TaskEditorModal.tsx` component has been updated to provide a better user experience for adding multiple tasks. When a new task is added, the modal now remains open, the form fields are cleared, and the task input field is automatically refocused, allowing for continuous task entry. The behavior for editing existing tasks remains unchanged, with the modal closing upon saving.

This successfully addresses the user's request.
